///// env variables 

To prevent accidentally leaking env variables to the client, only variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to your Vite-processed code. e.g. for the following env variables:


VITE_SOME_KEY=123
DB_PASSWORD=foobar
Only VITE_SOME_KEY will be exposed as import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY to your client source code, but DB_PASSWORD will not.

js
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY) // "123"
console.log(import.meta.env.DB_PASSWORD) // undefined

conf file so that just in case if that code doesnt work then entire app dosnt crash and to make code more readable

vendor lockin = write code such that if one day u decide to shift autentication from apprwrite to something else then also ur code works properly
so we use services
